# Notes on SICP
Some notes and some of the solutions solutions as I slowly work through. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I'm doing trying to do them in both Scheme and and JavaScript.

For the most part I'm sticking with the original version, reprinted by Sarabander here:

I'm also using Martin Henz's translation to JavaScript as a supplement. It can be found here: http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/sicp/

Starting out, I'm mostly using the BiwaScheme Interpreter version 0.6.4 on repl.it, although I might switch to Racket at some point.
